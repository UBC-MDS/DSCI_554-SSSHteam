### Survey

Survey link: https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_agz0I9HiBEeZqBL

The survey was conducted online anonymously during the lab session on April 3rd, 2019. We expected that most of the responders were UBC MDS students in the 2018-2019 cohort since the survey content focused on gathering MDS students' study behaviour and location preference. In total, we received 65 responses.
