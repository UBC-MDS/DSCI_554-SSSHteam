## Objective

The members of our team have various study habits. Some of us live close to school, other live farther away and we all have different preferences when it comes to where we study. We wanted to know if the study location could have an effect on the time an individual takes to complete the weekly labs. Do people who choose to work at home perhaps get more distracted? or do they have more time to commit to the labs since they have no commuting time? To address this question we created a survey to obtain data to conduct our analysis. 


#### Research Question 

Our team created the following analysis to address the following research question:

**"Does a person's choice of study location (home/academic setting/other public spaces) affect the time they take to finish their MDS assignments (exclusion of optional questions)?"**


## Project Set Up

* Collaboration Strategy:  We will be using the standard git branching for contributing to this project repository.

* Survey Tool: [UBC Qualtrics](https://ubc.qualtrics.com)   
  *Note: The server is hosted in Canada.*

* Survey Proposal: [Milestone1](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_554-lab-time-analysis/blob/master/doc/Milestone1.md)

### Survey

Survey link: https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_agz0I9HiBEeZqBL

The survey was conducted online anonymously during the lab session on April 3rd, 2019. We expected that most of the responders were UBC MDS students in the 2018-2019 cohort since the survey content focused on gathering MDS students' study behaviour and location preference. In total, we received 59 responses.
