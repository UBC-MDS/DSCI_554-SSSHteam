# Milestone 1



##### Identify the question that your team in interested in answering with the survey. The aim of the survey should be to try to answer one specific and testable question. Examples of specific and testable questions include (you can use one of these if you really like them):

> "Does a person’s choice of study location (home/academic setting/other public or private spaces) affect their productivity?”

##### Describe how you plan to analyze the survey results (e.g., what statistical test(s) do you plan to employ?).




##### Discuss the aspects of the UBC Office of Research Ethics document on Using Online Surveys that are relevant to your proposed survey.

We will be ensuring that all personal information collected by the survey is in custody and under control solely store in Canada and only accessed in Canada. 
We do not anticipate collecting any directly identifiable information from any of the participants such as SIN numbers, student numbers, IP addresses or names. In addition, the collection of indirectly identifying information is not foreseen in this survey.  Since our question revolves around the notion of Personal opinions, we do not anticipate collecting anything of which FIPPA constitutes "personal information".  That being said, we will be using the UBC-hosted version of Qualtrics as a precaution and to ensure that the data is secure, stored and backed up within Canada.  
Our data collection will be conducted solely in the form of an online survey and this we plan to use a cover letter in place of a fully signed consent form. The cover letter will include enough information about the purpose and requirement of the survey that enables the potential participant to make a valid and informed decision to contribute to the study.  
To comply with the UBC Office of Research Ethics we will include the following on the cover letter:

* The sentence "By completing the questionnaire, you are consenting to participate in this research."
* Study title
* The contact information of all 4 team members, and our Lab instructors (Vincenzo Coia)
* A description of the study 
* Any Risks and benefits we anticipate from the results 
* Whom benefits from the study 
* Limits to confidentiality 
* A statement indicating that participation is voluntary and not obligatory in any way.
* The UBC Research Participant Complaint Line text
* The UBC letterhead (if we can obtain it)

Amendments to the cover letter contents could occur depending on if changes or adjustments to the survey questions materialize in Milestone2.
